If you don't already have a private/public key setup, generate one.

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "jenkinuser@jenkinshost" -N ''

Then add the public key id_rsa.pub to chefuser@clienthost's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

    ssh-copy-id chefuser@clienthost

You may need to do this manually if you can't already login to clienthost with ssh.
Clean up any traces of old clients (your error message indicates this might be an issue)

    ssh-keygen -R clienthost

Test the ssh connection, and accept the host key.

    ssh chefuser@clienthost

Now on clienthost, setup sudo so chefuser can run chef-client as root

    visudo

Then add the line (Your chef-client path might be different)

    chefuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/chef-client

On jenkinshost, confirm ssh chefuser@clienthost sudo chef-client -v runs without password prompts.

    $ ssh chefuser@clienthost sudo /usr/local/bin/chef-client -v
    Chef: 11.16.0
