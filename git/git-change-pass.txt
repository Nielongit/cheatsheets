Start the console with this command:
> gitlab-rails console production

Next wait until the console has loaded. You will see something like this if everything is OK:
Gitlab Rails Console

Now there are multiple ways to find your user. In my case I know there was only one user and it had so it has ID 1. But you can also search for email or username.
irb(main):001:0> u = User.where(id: 1).first

Now lets change your password:
> u.password = 'secret_pass'
> u.password_confirmation = 'secret_pass'
	
Its important that you change both password and password_confirmation to make it work.
Now lets save the changes.
	
> u.save!
