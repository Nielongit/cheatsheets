2. Add it to the Neustar 3rd party jar Nexus repository

Do these steps only If you have a 3rd party jar that DOES NOT reside in maven central or another internet-facing repository

Then you can submit the jars through the project:

https://git.nexgen.neustar.biz/neustar/repo-3rd-party-jars/tree/master

Steps to take:

    Clone the repository:
    git clone ssh://git@git.nexgen.neustar.biz:8022/neustar/repo-3rd-party-jars.git

    create a new branch based on master:
    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout -b artifact-abc
    git push -u origin artifact-abc

    Add your jars to the ./lib directory in the repository

    Edit 'install.sh' and add a line for your artifact

    Upload the artifact:
    git push
    Create merge request

        Go to https://git.nexgen.neustar.biz/neustar/repo-3rd-party-jars/merge_requests
        Click on "+ New Merge Request" on the upper right
        Select your new branch in the "Source branch"
        select "master" in the "Target branch"
        Click on "Compare"
        write in the comment
            where this jar is from
            if it is a closed license: which team owns the license
        Assign it to someone from the Automation & Tools team
        "Submit merge request"
    Do not email the person who got this ticket assigned in the next two days. We get automatically notified by email.
    Wait till we follow up

If you have questions, please create a ticket in the "Sonatype Nexus Coderepository support (NEXUS)"  board in JIRA

 

After the changes are merged gitlab will automatically start a Jenkins job that will publish the artifacts. This job can be found at https://jenkins-denver.neustar.biz/job/automations-and-tools/job/Nexus-Third-Party-Jar-Uploader/
